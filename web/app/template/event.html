      <h2>Tea Ceremony</h2>
      <p>
        In a traditional Chinese wedding, the tea ceremony is one of the most
        significant events. It includes formal introductions of the bride and
        groom and shows respect to their families. Historically, after the bride
        and groom exchanged vows, the couple would serve tea to the groom's
        family (the bride would have served tea privately to her own family that
        morning). Today, many couples choose to honor both the bride and groom's
        families by hosting tea ceremonies for both sets of parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        At our wedding, we will be having an informal tea ceremony for both of
        our families. We will start with serving Eric’s side of the family
        first, and then proceed with serving Karen’s side of the family. The tea
        ceremony will be held at Hotel Healdsburg on Saturday, August 4th, 2018
        at 12pm. The whole ceremony should take approximately 30 to 45 minutes.
      </p>

      <h2>Accommodations</h2>
      <p>
        If you plan on staying overnight before or after the wedding, we
        recommend either a hotel in Healdsburg or Windsor, or a house rental
        through sites such as
        <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> or
        <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/" target="_blank">VRBO</a>. A few hotels
        we recommend are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hampton Inn & Suites Windsor</li>
        <li>Holiday Inn Windsor Wine Country</li>
        <li>Holiday Inn Express Windsor Sonoma Wine Country</li>
        <li>Hotel Healdsburg</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Wedding Day Transportation</h2>
      <p>
        Trentadue has plenty of parking, so driving to the venue should not be a
        problem. The winery is located approximately 10 minutes north of
        Healdsburg, 15 minutes north of Windsor, and 25 minutes north of Santa
        Rosa.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you prefer not to drive, we are planning on providing a shuttle from
        Windsor and Healdsburg which will pick up before the ceremony and return
        after the reception. The exact details are still to be determined, but
        please let us know in the RSVP so we can gauge interest. Ride sharing
        options such as <a href="https://www.lyft.com/" target="_blank">Lyft</a>
        and <a href="https://www.uber.com/" target="_blank">Uber</a> are also
        available in the area.
      </p>
